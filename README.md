-The script `Larvae_QC.R` was used to identify and remove contaminant ASVs as well as to remove any ASV assigned to chloroplast or mitochondria or ASVs with only zeros. The script also renames sample names and exports a new ASV table.

-The script `Larvae_ANCOMB_barplots.R` was used to identify taxa differentially more abundant in each larval stage.

-The script `Larvae_UpSet_plots.R` was used to plot ASVs that were overlapping across samples
